**OCT 2016**

PaaS (Cloud Platform As A Service)를 제공하는 Vercel에서  first release<br/>
*PaaS : A service that automatically manages the OS, hardware specs, etc., required to operate a service once it is deployed.

**6 Principles**
- ***out-of-the-box functionality requiring no setup***
- ***JavaScript everywhere(Frontned & Backend -> Full Stack)***
- ***automatic *code-splitting and server-rendering***
- ***configurable data-fetching***
- ***anticipating requests***
- ***simplifying deployment*** 

\* code-splitting : Instead of sending the entire bundled code to the user, it sends small pieces of the code corresponding to the part the user is viewing. (small -> fast)



**JULY 2020**
- Rewrite, Redirect
- Incremental Static Generation

**OCT 2022** (Next.js 13)
- new routing (/app)
- (nested) layouts
- Server Components
- streaming
- new toolchain (Turbopack)
