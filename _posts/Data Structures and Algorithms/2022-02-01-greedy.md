Algorithm is a set of <span style='font-size:1em'>***well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.***</span> <br>
It takes a set of input and produces a desired output.

{:toc .large-only}

**Qualities of Good Algorithms**

- Input and output should be defined precisely.
- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
- Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written - in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

## 1. Greedy

### 1.1 What is Greedy algorithm?

Greedy algorithm means a method to <span style='background-color: #FFF39B;'>*choose only good things from the current situation.*</span>

- A typical greedy algorithm requires the ability to come up with minimal ideas to solve a problem.
- It is important to analyze the legitimacy of the greedy solution.
  - Examine whether an optimal solution can be obtained by iteratively selecting the one that looks the best.

In a greedy algorithm problem,  it is <span style='background-color: #FFF39B; font-size:1.1em'>*necessary to be able to come up with a minimal ideas for solving the problem and examine whether this is justified.*</span>

### 1.2 Greedy Example Problem  

#### 1.2.1 Problem : Until it becomes 1 

Until a certain number N becomes 1, one of the following two processes is repeatedly selected and performed. However, the second operation can be selected only when N is divisible by K. 

1. Subtract 1 from N. 
2. Divide N by K. 

For example, if N = 17, K = 4 <br> 
1) 17 - 1 = 16  <br> 
2) 16 // 4 = 4 <br> 
3) 4 // 4 = 1 

The number of times the entire process is executed becomes 3. This is the minimum number of times to make N equal to 1.

**Input conditions** <br>
In the first line N (2 <= N <= 100,000) and K (2 <= K <= 100,000) separated by spaces, each given as a natural number.

**Output conditions** <br>
In the first line, print the minimum value for the number of times that one or two processes must be performed until N becomes 1.

| Input Example | Output Example |
|`25 5`|`2`|

#### 1.2.2 Solution : Until it becomes 1

Since K is greater than 2, dividing by K will always reduce N faster than subtracting 1. <br>
Also, N will always becomes 1. 

*Dividing as many as possible guarantees an optimal solution!*

~~~py
# Python
# Get input with N, K separated by spaces
n, k = map(int, input(). split())
result = 0

while True:
    # Subtract until N is divisible by K
     target = (n // k) * k
     result += (n - target)
     n = target
    # Escape from loop when N is less than K (not more divisible)
     if n < k:
     break
    # Divide by K
     result += 1
     n //= k
 
# Subtract 1 for the last remaining number
reslut += (n - 1)
print(result)
~~~

#### 1.2.3 Problom : Multiply or Add 

Given a string s where each digit consists of only numbers (0 to 9), check all numbers one by one from left to right, and insert the 'x' or '+' operator between the numbers to find the largest number that can be made as a result. Write a program to retrieve it. 
However, unlike the usual way of calculating x before +, it is assumed that all operations are performed in order from the left.

**Input conditions** <br>
The first line is given a string S of several numbers. (1<=S.length<=20)

**Output conditions** <br>
Print the largest possible number in the first line.

| Input Example 1 | Output Example 1|
|`02984`|`576`|

| Input Example 2 | Output Example 2|
|`567`|`210`|

#### 1.2.4 Solution : Multiply or Add 

In most cases, 'x' makes the value larger than '+'. For example, 5+6=11 and 5X6=30.
- However, if any of the two numbers is '0' or '1', it is more efficient to perform '+' rather than 'x'

*Therefore, when performing an operation on two numbers, if one of the two numbers is less than 1, '+' it, and if both numbers are 2 or more, 'x' is the correct answer.*

~~~py
# Python
data = input()

# Replace the first character with a number
result = int(data[0])

for i in range(1, len(data)):
     # If either number is '0' or '1', '+' rather than 'x'.
     num = int(data[i])
     if num <= 1 or result <= 1:
         result += num
     else:
         result *= num

print(result)
~~~
