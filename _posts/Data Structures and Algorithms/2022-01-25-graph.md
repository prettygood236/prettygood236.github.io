## 1. What is Graph?
---

Graphs are collections of things and <u>the relationships or connections</u> between them. <br>
The data in a graph are called ***nodes or vertices.***<br>
The connections between the nodes are called ***edges.***

## 2. Type of Graph

**Undirected and Directed**

---
![Graph_Undirected and Directed](/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph/graph-2.png){:width="650"}

Undirected graphs are graphs without any direction on the edges between nodes.
* ex) social network

Directed graphs are graphs with a direction and its edges.
* ex)  internet and web page links. The nodes are web pages and the directed edges are links to other pages.


## 3. Graph Representation

### 3.1 Adjacency List 
---

<span style='background-color: #FFF39B; font-size:1em'>*Adjacency List associates each vertex in the graph with the collection of its neighboring vertices or edges.*</span>

![Graph_Adjacency list and Matrix](/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph/graph_adjacency list and matrix.png){:width="650"}

### 3.2 Adjacency Matrix 
---

<span style='background-color: #FFF39B; font-size:1em'>*Adjacency Matrix is a two-dimensional array where each nested array has the same number of
elements as the outer array.*</span> So it's basically a matrix of numbers where the numbers represent the edges.

### 3.3 Incidence Matrix 
---

![Graph_Incidence Matrix](/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph/graph_incidence matrix.png){:width="650"}

Adjacency Matrix use both rows and columns to represent nodes.<br>
But <span style='background-color: #FFF39B; font-size:1em'>*Incidence Matrix uses roads to represent nodes and the columns to represent edges.*</span>
This means that we can have an uneven number of rows and columns.
Each column will represent a unique edge. Also, each edge connects two nodes to show that there is edge between two nodes.
