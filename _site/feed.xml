It takes a set of input and produces a desired output.

**Qualities of Good Algorithms**

- Input and output should be defined precisely.
- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
- Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written - in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

## 1. Greedy

### 1.1 What is Greedy algorithm?

Greedy algorithm means a method to &lt;span style='background-color: #FFF190;'&gt;*choose only good things from the current situation.*&lt;/span&gt;

- A typical greedy algorithm requires the ability to come up with minimal ideas to solve a problem.
- It is important to analyze the legitimacy of the greedy solution.
  - Examine whether an optimal solution can be obtained by iteratively selecting the one that looks the best.

In a greedy algorithm problem,  it is &lt;span style='background-color: #FFF190; font-size:1.1em'&gt;*necessary to be able to come up with a minimal ideas for solving the problem and examine whether this is justified.*&lt;/span&gt;

### 1.2 Greedy Example Problem  

#### 1.2.1 Problem : Until it becomes 1 

Until a certain number N becomes 1, one of the following two processes is repeatedly selected and performed. However, the second operation can be selected only when N is divisible by K. 

1. Subtract 1 from N. 
2. Divide N by K. 

For example, if N = 17, K = 4 &lt;br&gt; 
1) 17 - 1 = 16  &lt;br&gt; 
2) 16 // 4 = 4 &lt;br&gt; 
3) 4 // 4 = 1 

The number of times the entire process is executed becomes 3. This is the minimum number of times to make N equal to 1.

**Difficulty: 1 \| 15 minutes to solve \| Time limit 2 seconds \| Memory limit 128 MB**
{:.message}

**Input conditions** &lt;br&gt;
In the first line N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) and K (2 &lt;= K &lt;= 100,000) separated by spaces, each given as a natural number.

**Output conditions** &lt;br&gt;
In the first line, print the minimum value for the number of times that one or two processes must be performed until N becomes 1.

| Input Example | Output Example |
|`25 5`|`2`|

#### 1.2.2 Solution : Until it becomes 1

Since K is greater than 2, dividing by K will always reduce N faster than subtracting 1. &lt;br&gt;
Also, N will always becomes 1. 

*Dividing as many as possible guarantees an optimal solution!*

~~~py
# python
# get input with N, K separated by spaces
n, k = map(int, input(). split())
result = 0

while True:
    # subtract until N is divisible by K
     target = (n // k) * k
     result += (n - target)
     n = target
    # escape from loop when N is less than K (not more divisible)
     if n &lt; k:
     break
    # divide by K
     result += 1
     n //= k
 
# subtract 1 for the last remaining number
reslut += (n - 1)
print(result)
~~~

#### 1.2.3 Problom : Multiply or Add 

Given a string s where each digit consists of only numbers (0 to 9), check all numbers one by one from left to right, and insert the 'x' or '+' operator between the numbers to find the largest number that can be made as a result. Write a program to retrieve it. 
However, unlike the usual way of calculating x before +, it is assumed that all operations are performed in order from the left.

{:.message}

**Input conditions** &lt;br&gt;
The first line is given a string S of several numbers. (1&lt;=S.length&lt;=20)

**Output conditions** &lt;br&gt;
Print the largest possible number in the first line.

| Input Example 1 | Output Example 1|
|`02984`|`576`|

| Input Example 2 | Output Example 2|
|`567`|`210`|

#### 1.2.4 Solution : Multiply or Add 

In most cases, 'x' makes the value larger than '+'. For example, 5+6=11 and 5X6=30.
- However, if any of the two numbers is '0' or '1', it is more efficient to perform '+' rather than 'x'

*Therefore, when performing an operation on two numbers, if one of the two numbers is less than 1, '+' it, and if both numbers are 2 or more, 'x' is the correct answer.*

~~~py
# python
data = input()

# replace the first character with a number
result = int(data[0])

for i in range(1, len(data)):
     # if either number is '0' or '1', '+' rather than 'x'.
     num = int(data[i])
     if num &lt;= 1 or result &lt;= 1:
         result += num
     else:
         result *= num

print(result)

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 What is Implementation?

Implementation is &lt;span style='background-color: #FFF190; font-size:1.1em'&gt;*the process of converting an algorithm in your head into source code.*&lt;/span&gt;

Example of implementation type problem is:
- The algorithm is simple, but the code becomes excessively long.
- Problems dealing with real numbers and outputting to a certain number of decimal places.
- Problems that have to be dealt with by breaking strings according to certain criteria.
- The problem of finding and using the appropriate library.

There are many similarities between the type ***Simulation*** , ***Implementation***, and ***Brute-Force*** in coding tests.

### 2.2 Implementation Example Problem  


#### 2.2.1 Problem : Left, Right, Up, Down

Traveler A stands on a square space of size N × N. This space is divided into squares of size 1 × 1. &lt;br&gt;
The upper-left coordinate corresponds to (1, 1), and the lower-right coordinate corresponds to (N, N). &lt;br&gt;
Traveler A can move up, down, left and right, and the starting coordinate is always (1, 1). In front of us is a plan with traveler A's plans to move.

In the plan, one letter of L, R, U, and D is repeatedly written on one line based on space.
The meaning of each character is as follows.

L: move one space to the left &lt;br&gt;
R: move one space to the right &lt;br&gt;
U: move up one space &lt;br&gt;
D: move down one space &lt;br&gt;

In this case, the movement of traveler A outside the square space of size N × N is ignored. &lt;br&gt;
For example, if L or U is encountered at position (1, 1), it is ignored. &lt;br&gt;

**Input conditions** &lt;br&gt;
The first line is given an N indicating the size of the space. (1&lt;=N&lt;=100)
In the second line, the contents of the travel plan for traveler A are given. (1&lt;=Number of moves&lt;=100)

**Output conditions** &lt;br&gt;
In the first line, print the number written on the card selected according to the rules of the game.

| Input Example | Output Example|
|`5`|`3 4`|
|`R R R U D D`|

#### 2.2.2 Solution : Left, Right, Up, Down

This is a problem that needs to implement faithfully according to the requirements.

~~~py
# python
# get N input
n = int(input())
x, y = 1, 1
plans = input(). split()

# direction of movement according to L, R, U, D
dx = [0, 0, -1, 1]
dy = [-1, 1, 0, 0]
move_types = ['L', 'R', 'U', 'D']

# check the move plans one by one
for plan in plans:
     # get coordinates after moving
     for i in range(len(move_types)):
         if plan == move_types[i]:
             nx = x + dx[i]
             ny = y + dy[i]
     # ignore if out of space
     if nx &lt; 1 or ny &lt; 1 or nx &gt; n or ny &gt; n:
         continue
     # perform a move
     x, y = nx, ny

print(x, y)
~~~

#### 2.2.3 Problem : Royal Knight

When the position of the knight on the 8 × 8 coordinate plane is given, the number of cases in which the knight can move is output. A knight can move from a specific location in the following two cases:

1. Move two spaces horizontally and then move one space vertically
2. Move two spaces vertically and then move one space horizontally

Write a program. In the royal garden, row positions are expressed as 1 to 8, and column positions are expressed as
express from a to h.

![Royal Knight](/assets/img/coding-test/royal-knight.png){:width=&quot;50%&quot;}

There are 6 possible moves when in c2.&lt;br&gt;
There are 2 possible moves when in a1.

**Difficulty: 1 \| 20 minutes to solve \| Time limit 1 seconds \| Memory limit 128 MB**
{:.message}

**Input conditions** &lt;br&gt;
In the first line, a two-character string representing the coordinates of where the knight is currently located on the 8x8 coordinate plane is entered. Input characters consist of columns and rows, like a1.

**Output conditions** &lt;br&gt;
In the first line, print the number of times a knight can move.

| Input Example | Output Example|
|a1|2|

#### 2.2.4 Solution : Royal Knight

Check the 8 paths of the knight one by one and check if it is possible to move to each location. &lt;br&gt;
Using the list, define direction vectors for 8 directions.

~~~py
# python
# get the current knight's location
input_data = input()
row = int(input_data[1])
column = int(ord(input_data[0])) - int(ord('a')) + 1

# define 8 directions a knight can move
steps = [(-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2 ), (-2, 1)]

# check if it is possible to move to each position in 8 directions
result = 0
for step in steps:
     # check the location you want to move
     next_row = row + step[0]
     next_column = column + step[1]
     # if it is possible to move to that location, the count is increased.
     if next_row &gt;= 1 and next_row &lt;= 8 and next_column &gt;= 1 and next_column &lt;= 8:
         result += 1

print(result)

## 3. DFS &amp; BFS

### 3.1 What is Depth-First Search?

DFS is literally an algorithm that searches the deep part first.&lt;br&gt;
DFS uses a stack data structure (or recursive function)

**DFS operation process**
1. Insert the search start node into the stack and process the visit.
2. If there is at least one unvisited adjacent node at the top node of the stack, the node is push into the stack and visited. If there are no unvisited adjacent nodes, pop the topmost node from the stack.
3. Repeat until step 2 can no longer be performed.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


### 3.3 Tree : DFS Implementation

~~~js
// simple tree (no membership check)
let Node = function (value) {
  this.value = value;
  this.children = [];
};
Node.prototype.addChild = function (child) {
  this.children.push(child);
  return child;
};

let dfs = function (node) {
  let result = [node.value]
  // console.log(result)
  node.children.forEach(el=&gt;{
    result = result.concat(dfs(el))
    // console.log(el)
    // console.log(result)
  })
  return result  
}
let root = new Node(1);
let rootChild1 = root.addChild(new Node(2));
let rootChild2 = root.addChild(new Node(3));
let leaf1 = rootChild1.addChild(new Node(4));
let leaf2 = rootChild1.addChild(new Node(5));
leaf1.addChild(new Node(6));
rootChild2.addChild(new Node(7));
output = dfs(root);
console.log(output); // --&gt; [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 7]
~~~
&lt;br&gt;


### 3.4 Graph : DFS Implementation

~~~js
function bfs(graph, root) {
  let nodesLen = {};
  
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; graph.length; i++) {
    nodesLen[i] = Infinity;
  }
  nodesLen[root] = 0; 
  
  let queue = [root]; 
  let current; 

  while (queue.length != 0) {
    current = queue.shift();
    
    let curConnected = graph[current];
    let neighborIdx = []; 
    let idx = curConnected.indexOf(1); 
    while (idx != -1) {
      neighborIdx.push(idx); 
      idx = curConnected.indexOf(1, idx + 1); 
    }
    
    for (let j = 0; j &lt; neighborIdx.length; j++) {
      if (nodesLen[neighborIdx[j]] == Infinity) {
        nodesLen[neighborIdx[j]] = nodesLen[current] + 1;
        queue.push(neighborIdx[j]); 
      }
    }
  }
  return nodesLen;
};

let exBFSGraph = [
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
];
console.log(bfs(exBFSGraph, 1)); //{ '0': 2, '1': 0, '2': 1, '3': 3, '4': Infinity }
~~~
&lt;br&gt;


## 4. Dynamic Programming

### 4.1 What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is a method to dramatically improve execution time efficiency by properly using memory.
It saves &lt;span style='background-color: #FFF190'&gt;*already calculated results (small problems) in a separate memory area to avoid recalculation.*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
- In general, it can be implemented in two ways: Top-down and Bottom-up.

Dynamic programming can be used when the problem satisfies the following conditions.

&lt;span style='background-color: #E5FFCC'&gt;***1. Obtimal Substructure***&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
\: A big problem can be divided into small problems, and the big problem can be solved by collecting the answers to the divided small problems. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style='background-color: #E5FFCC'&gt;***2. Overlapping Subproblem***&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
\: You have to solve the same small problem over and over again.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of the following form, and can be effectively calculated with dynamic programming.

$$
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
$$

The ignition expression means a relational expression between adjacent identities. &lt;br&gt;
The Fibonacci sequence can be expressed as an ignition formula as follows:

$$
a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2},\quad a_1 = 1, \quad a_2 = 1
$$

Solving the Fibonacci sequence with a simple recursive function has exponential time complexity. &lt;br&gt;
You can see that f(2) is called multiple times as follows. -&gt; &lt;span style='background-color: #E5FFCC'&gt;***Overlapping Subproblem***&lt;/span&gt;

## Introduction to Linux and shells

### Unix &lt;br&gt;

![Operating Systems](/assets/img/cli/operating-systems-timeline-and-family-tree.png){:width=100%} &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Operating Systems: Timeline and Family Tree &lt;br&gt;

{:.figure}

Everything in red here is considered in some way related uh or indebted to **Unix**.&lt;br&gt;
That includes things like linux, unbuntu, macOS.

Unix was an operating system developed at Bell Labs in the mid 1960's. &lt;br&gt;
Many of the innovations and design choices the original Unix team have lived on 50+ years later, including the idea of **multi-user operating systems and hierarchical file systems.**&lt;br&gt;

Unix is the &quot;grandfather&quot; of many modern operating systems that we frequently use today. 

Even these days most operating systems can be grouped into two families:
- The Microsoft NT descendants including Windows, Xbox OS, and Windows Phone/Mobile
- Pretty much everything else has lineage going back to **Unix**, including Mac OS, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, and even the PS4 OS.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

### Linux &lt;br&gt;

**GNU**  &lt;br&gt;

(pink) is closed source and that means the code is completely closed off. You can't edit it, you can't view it, you're not allowed to even try to tweak it.

(green) we have open source which you may be familiar with that term. The code is openly
viewable. you can change it, tweak it, make your own versions try things out.

(yellow) this is mixed/shared source type of operating system.

Richard Stallman was a leader in the group of developers who aimed to create Free Software 
alternatives to Unix.

In 1984 he began work on the GNU Project, with the goal of creating an operating system that included &quot;everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free&quot;.

**The Linux Kernel**  &lt;br&gt;

![Kernel_Layout](/assets/img/cli/Kernel_Layout.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kernel Layout
{:.figure}

Another developer, Linus Torvalds, was working on creating his own kernel known as Linux. The kernel is the part of an OS that facilitates interactions between hardware and software. 

At the time, many GNU &quot;pieces&quot; were complete, but it lacked a kernel. Torvalds combined his kernel with the existing GNU components to create a full operating system. This is called Linux

**GNU/Linux** &lt;br&gt;

Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.

It is also **the most popular Open Source operating system**, and it gives you the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.

Linux is also special because there's not just &quot;one Linux&quot;, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have distributions. For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.

If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX. 

Microsoft has an official Windows Subsystem for Linux which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.

UNIX is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70's.
{:.note}

### Linux shell

A shell is a **command interpreter** that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.

It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.

Shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.

Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!

All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called sh. &quot;Bourne&quot; because its creator was Steve Bourne. 

Bash means Bourne-again shell. sh was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.

If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).

You can set up your system to run any kind of shell.

Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.
&lt;br&gt;

## 1. `man` command

![man](/assets/img/cli/man_command-1.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;
`man ls` result 
{:.figure}

Every time we don't know how to use a command, We can type `man &lt;command&gt;` to get the manual.&lt;br&gt;
Then you can use the `man` page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.


### tldr

When need to learn a command quickly we can use this site called tldr pages: [https://tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/) {:target=_&quot;blank&quot;} (Is tldr an abbreviation for Too Long Don't Read? lol)

![man](/assets/img/cli/man_command-2.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;
`tldr ls` result 
{:.figure}

It's a command you can install, which you then run like this: tldr &lt;command&gt;. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios. Korean language support is also available.

## 2. `alias` command

You can create a new command, for example I like to call it ls -al to ll, You can do it like this:

```bash
alias ll='ls -al'
```
![alias](/assets/img/cli/alias_command-1.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;
`alias ll` result 
{:.figure}

The alias will work until the terminal session is closed.

To make it permanent, you need to add it to the shell configuration. This could be ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile if you use the Bash shell, depending on the use case.
And apply the created file using the following command.

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile 
```

## 3. `less` command

It shows you the content stored inside a file, in a nice and interactive UI.

Usage: `less &lt;filename&gt;`

![less](/assets/img/cli/less_command-1.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;

Once you are inside a `less` session, you can quit by pressing `q`.

You can navigate the file contents using the `up` and `down` keys, or using the `space bar` and `b` to navigate page by page. You can also jump to the end of the file pressing `G` and jump back to the start by pressing `g`.

You can search contents inside the file by pressing `/` and typing a word to search. This searches forward. You can search backwards using the `?` symbol and typing a word.

This command just visualises the file's content. You can directly open an editor by pressing `v`. It will use the system editor, which in most cases is `vim`.

Pressing the `F` key enters follow mode, or watch mode. When the file is changed by someone else, like from another program, you get to see the changes live.

This doesn't happen by default, and you only see the file version at the time you opened it. You need to press `ctrl-C` to quit this mode. In this case the behaviour is similar to running the `tail -f &lt;filename&gt;` command.

You can open multiple files, and navigate through them using `:n` (to go to the next file) and `:p` (to go to the previous).

## 4. `tail` command

The best use case of tail in my opinion is when called with the `-f` option. It opens the file at the end, and watches for file changes.

Any time there is new content in the file, it is printed in the window. This is great for watching log files, for example:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/system.log
```

To exit, press `ctrl-C`.

You can print the last 10 lines in a file:

```bash
tail -n 10 &lt;filename&gt;
```

You can print the whole file content starting from a specific line using `+` before the line number:

```bash
tail -n +10 &lt;filename&gt;
```

`tail` can do much more and as always my advice is to check `man tail`.

## 5. `grep` command

When you master `grep` command, it will help you tremendously in your day to day coding.
You can use `grep` to search in files, or combine it with pipes to filter the output of another command.
For example here's how we can find the occurences of the document.getElementById line in the index.md file:

```bash
grep -n document.getElementById index.md
```
![grep](/assets/img/cli/grep_command-1.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;

Using the `-n` option it will show the line numbers:

```bash
grep -n document.getElementById index.md
```
![grep](/assets/img/cli/grep_command-2.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;

One very useful thing is to tell grep to print 2 lines before and 2 lines after the matched line to give you more context. That's done using the `-C` option, which accepts a number of lines:

```bash
grep -nC 2 document.getElementById index.md
```
![grep](/assets/img/cli/grep_command-3.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;

Search is case sensitive by default. Use the `-i` flag to make it insensitive.

As mentioned, you can use grep to filter the output of another command. We can replicate the same functionality as above using:

```bash
less index.md | grep -n document.getElementById
```
![grep](/assets/img/cli/grep_command-4.png){:width=&quot;600&quot;} &lt;br&gt;

The search string can be a regular expression, and this makes `grep` very powerful.

Another thing you might find very useful is to invert the result, excluding the lines that match a particular string, using the `-v` option:

## 1. Design System

### 1.1 Design System

**UI 컴포넌트들의 모음을 구조화 하는 방법**
* 디자인 시스템이란 서비스를 만드는 데 사용한 공통 컬러, 서체, 인터랙션, 각종 정책 및 규정에 관한 모든 컴포넌트를 정리해놓은 것이며 불필요한 커뮤니케이션을 없애기 위해 체계적으로 정리한 시스템을 말한다.
* UI 컴포넌트는 사용자 인터페이스를 이루는 조각들의 시각적이고 기능적인 속성을 마치 레고(LEGO) 블록처럼 캡슐화한다.
* 최근에 등장한 유저 인터페이스(UI)들은 다양한 사용자 경험을 제공하기 위해 수백 개의 모듈식 UI 컴포넌트가 재배열된 구조로 이루어져 있다.
* 디자인 시스템은 재사용이 가능한 UI 컴포넌트들로 이루어져, 복잡하고 견고하며 사용자가 접근하기에 용이한 사용자 인터페이스를 구축할 수 있다. 
* 디자이너와 개발자 모두 UI 컴포넌트를 다루기 때문에, 디자인 시스템은 두 분야를 연결하는 다리이기도 하다. 또한 조직의 공용 컴포넌트에 대한 &quot;진실의 근원(source of truth)&quot;이기도 하다.
* [Uber](https://github.com/uber/baseweb){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/lunar){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, [IBM](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/){:.target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, [GitHub](https://primer.style/css/){:.target=&quot;_blank&quot;}을 비롯한 수백 개가 넘는 기업의 디자인 시스템에서 스토리북이 사용되고 있다. 아래 목록은 그 중 가장 우수한 팀에서 사용되고 있는 Tool들이다.

&lt;br&gt;

### 1.2 Storybook

UI 개발 즉, **Component Driven Development**를 하기 위한 도구
* 각각의 컴포넌트들을 따로 볼 수 있게 구성해주어 한 번에 하나의 컴포넌트에서 작업할 수 있다.
* 재사용성을 확대하기 위해 컴포넌트를 문서화하고, 자동으로 컴포넌트를 시각화하여 전체 UI를 한눈에 볼 수 있다.
* 시뮬레이션할 수 있는 다양한 테스트 상태를 확인하고 이를 통해 버그를 사전에 방지할 수 있도록 도와준다. 
* 테스트 및 개발 속도를 향상시키는 장점이 있으며, 애플리케이션 또한 의존성을 걱정하지 않고 빌드할 수 있다.


### 1.3 Storybook 주요 기능

* UI 컴포넌트들을 카탈로그 화하기
* 컴포넌트 변화를 Stories로 저장하기
* 핫 모듈 재 로딩과 같은 개발 툴 경험을 제공하기
* 리액트를 포함한 다양한 뷰 레이어 지원하기 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

## 2. CSS 방법론

### 2.1 CSS 전처리기(CSS Preprocessor)

CSS가 구조적으로 작성될 수 있게 도움을 주는 도구
* CSS의 문제점들을 프로그래밍 개념(변수, 함수, 상속 등)을 활용하여 해결할 수 있도록 한다.
* CSS 전처리기(CSS Preprocessor) 자체만으로는 웹 서버가 인지하지 못하기 때문에 각 CSS 전처리기에 맞는 Compiler를 사용해야 하고 컴파일을 하게 되면 실제로 우리가 사용하는 CSS 문서로 변환이 된다.


### 2.2 SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
![SASS](/assets/img/react/react-component-design/sass.png)

CSS 전처리기 중에서 가장 유명한 SASS는 CSS를 확장해 주는 스크립팅 언어
* 즉, CSS를 만들어주는 언어로서 자바스크립트처럼 특정 속성(ex. color, margin, width 등)의 값(ex. #ffffff, 25rem, 100px 등)을 변수로 선언하여 필요한 곳에 선언된 변수를 적용할 수도 있고, 반복되는 코드를 한 번의 선언으로 여러 곳에서 재사용할 수 있다.
* SCSS 코드를 읽어서 전처리한 다음 컴파일해서 전역 CSS 번들 파일을 만들어 주는 전처리기(preprocessor)
* 스타일이 겹치는 문제를 해결하기 위해 단순히 계층 구조를 만들어 내는 것에 의지하며, 그 결과 컴파일된 CSS의 용량은 어마어마하게 커지는 치명적인 단점이 있다.
&lt;br&gt;

### 2.3 CSS 방법론
방법론의 지향점은 다음과 같다. 
* 코드의 재사용
* 코드의 간결화(유지 보수 용이)
* 코드의 확장성
* 코드의 예측성(클래스 명으로 의미 예측)

### 2.4 BEM
![BEM](/assets/img/react/react-component-design/bem.png)

대표적인 CSS 방법론인 BEM이란 Block, Element, Modifier로 구분하여 클래스명을 작성하는 방법
* Block, Element, Modifier 각각은 —와 __로 구분
* 클래스명은 BEM 방식의 이름을 여러 번 반복하여 재사용할 수 있도록 하며 HTML/CSS/SASS 파일에서도 더 일관된 코딩 구조를 만들어 준다.
* 클래스명 선택자가 장황해지고, 이런 긴 클래스명 때문에 마크업이 불필요하게 커지며, 재사용하려고 할 때마다 모든 UI 컴포넌트를 명시적으로 확장해야는 단점이 있다.
&lt;br&gt;

### 2.5 각 CSS 방법론의 특징과 장, 단점
![CSS-Methlogy](/assets/img/react/react-component-design/css-methlogy.png)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

## 3. Styled-Component
![Styled-Component](/assets/img/react/react-component-design/styled-component.png)

SASS와 BEM도 고치지 못했던 몇 가지 문제들은 언어 로직 상에 진정한 캡슐화의 개념이 없다는 것이었고, 이로 인해 개발자들이 유일한 클래스명을 선택하는 것에 의존할 수밖에 없었다. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Styled-Component는 **캡슐화(encapsulation : 객체의 속성과 행위를 하나로 묶고 실제 구현 내용 일부를 외부에 감추어 은닉하는 개념)**를 가능하게 한다.
* 가장 인기있는 CSS-in-JS 관련 React 라이브러리
* 기능적(Functional) 혹은 상태를 가진 컴포넌트들로부터 UI를 완전히 분리해 사용할 수 있는 아주 단순한 패턴을 제공 
* 기존 CSS 문법으로도 스타일 속성이 추가된 React 컴포넌트를 만들 수 있다. 

~~~js
const Button = styled.a`
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 0.5rem 0;
  margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
  width: 11rem;
`;

Styled Component 를 이용한 Button 생성
{:.figure}

### 3.1 Styled Component의 특징

**Automatic critical CSS**&lt;br&gt;
* 화면에 어떤 컴포넌트가 렌더링 되었는지 추적해서 해당하는 컴포넌트에 대한 스타일을 자동으로 삽입한다. 
* 따라서 코드를 적절히 분배해 놓으면 사용자가 어플리케이션을 사용할 때 최소한의 코드만으로 화면이 띄워지도록 할 수 있다.

**No class name bugs**&lt;br&gt;
* 스스로 유니크한 className 을 생성하여 className 의 중복이나 오타로 인한 버그를 줄여준다.

**Easier deletion of CSS**&lt;br&gt;
* 모든 스타일 속성이 특정 컴포넌트와 연결되어 있기 때문에 만약 컴포넌트를 더 이상 사용하지 않아 삭제할 경우 이에 대한 스타일 속성도 함께 삭제된다.

**Simple dynamic styling**&lt;br&gt;
* className을 일일이 수동으로 관리할 필요 없이 React 의 props 나 전역 속성을 기반으로 컴포넌트에 스타일 속성을 부여하기 때문에 간단하고 직관적이다.

**Painless maintenance**&lt;br&gt;
* 컴포넌트에 스타일을 상속하는 속성을 찾아 다른 CSS 파일들을 검색하지 않아도 되기 때문에 코드의 크기가 커지더라도 유지보수가 어렵지 않다.

**Automatic vendor prefixing**&lt;br&gt;
* 개별 컴포넌트마다 기존의 CSS 를 이용하여 스타일 속성을 정의하면 이외의 것들은 Styled Component 가 알아서 처리해 준다.
&lt;br&gt;

### 3.2 Getting Started

~~~js
import styled from &quot;styled-components&quot;;

// &lt;h1&gt; 태그를 렌더링 할 title component를 만든다.
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 3em;
  text-align: center;
  color: MidnightBlue;
`;

// &lt;section&gt; 태그를 렌더링 할 Wrapper component를 만든다.
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 6em;
  background: LemonChiffon;
`;

export default function App() {
  // 일반적으로 컴포넌트를 사용하는 것처럼 Title과 Wrapper를 사용하면 된다!
  return (
    &lt;Wrapper&gt;
      &lt;Title&gt;Hello CHAN!&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;/Wrapper&gt;
  );
}
~~~
`&lt;Title&gt;`과 `&lt;Wrapper&gt;` 라는 컴포넌트에 스타일 속성을 정의한 후 React 에서 컴포넌트를 사용하는 것과 동일하게 리턴문 안에서 해당 컴포넌트들을 사용하고 있으며, `&lt;h1&gt;` tag 의 스타일 속성은 styled.h1 , `&lt;section&gt;` tag 의 스타일 속성은 styled.section 를 사용하고 있다.

&lt;br&gt;

### 3.3 Adapting based on props &amp; Extending Styles

Styled Component 는 **스타일 속성을 지닌 컴포넌트를 정의할 때에 함수를 전달하고, 그 함수 안에서 props 를 사용**할 수도 있다. &lt;br&gt;
또한 **같은 스타일 속성을 지닌 여러개의 컴포넌트들 중 몇 개의 컴포넌트에 약간의 변화를 주고 싶은 때**에는 상속받고자 하는 스타일 속성을 지닌 컴포넌트를 `styled()` 로 감싼 뒤, 변경하고 싶은 속성만 새로 정의해 주면 기존 속성을 확장하여 사용할 수 있다. 

~~~js
import styled from &quot;styled-components&quot;;

  // Button component
const Button = styled.button`
  /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
  background: ${(props) =&gt; (props.primary ? &quot;palevioletred&quot; : &quot;white&quot;)};
  color: ${(props) =&gt; (props.primary ? &quot;white&quot; : &quot;palevioletred&quot;)};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
`;

const Tomato = styled(Button)`
  color: tomato;
  border-color: tomato;
`;

// App component
export default function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Button&gt;Normal&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button primary&gt;Primary&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Tomato&gt;Tomato&lt;/Tomato&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
~~~

`&lt;Button&gt;` 컴포넌트의 background 와 color 속성은 primary 라는 props 의 전달 여부에 따라 컬러값을 정의하고 있다. &lt;br&gt; 
기존의 Button 컴포넌트에 Tomato 컴포넌트만을 위한 새로운 속성을 추가한 것이다.
{:.figure}
&lt;br&gt;

결과
{:.figure}
&lt;br&gt;

### 3.4 Passed props

컴포넌트에 **props 로 스타일 속성이 전달**된다면 해당 컴포넌트는 **props 로 전달된 속성을 우선 적용**하며, 전달되는 속성이 없다면 기본으로 설정된 속성을 적용한다. 이는 Styled Component 가 개발자에 의해 설정된 속성과 기본 속성을 구분할 수 있기 때문이다.

~~~js
import styled from &quot;styled-components&quot;;

// Styled Component로 만들어진 Input 컴포넌트
const Input = styled.input`
  padding: 0.5em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  color: ${(props) =&gt; props.inputColor || &quot;red&quot;};
  background: papayawhip;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 3px;
`;

export default function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {/* 아래 Input 컴포넌트는 styled component인 Input 컴포넌트에 지정된 inputColor(red)가 적용되었다.  */}
      &lt;Input defaultValue=&quot;김코딩&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
      {/* 아래 Input 컴포넌트는 props로 전달된 커스텀 inputColor(blue)가 적용되었다. */}
      &lt;Input defaultValue=&quot;박해커&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; inputColor=&quot;blue&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
~~~
props 로 color 속성이 전달된 Input 컴포넌트는 해당 color 속성이 글자색에 적용되고, props 가 전달되지 않은 Input 컴포넌트는 기본 색상(여기서는 빨간색)이 적용된 것을 확인할 수 있다. 
{:.figure}

## 4. DOM reference를 잘 활용할 수 있는 useRef

### 4.1 useRef

React는 DOM 엘리먼트의 주소값을 활용(focus, text selection, media playback, 에니메이션 적용
d3.js, greensock 및 DOM 기반 라이브러리 활용 등)해야 하는 예외적인 상황에서 **useRef**으로 DOM 노드, 엘리먼트, 그리고 리액트 컴포넌트 주소값을 참조할 수 있다. 

~~~js
const 주소값을_담는_그릇 = useRef(참조자료형)
// 이제 주소값을_담는_그릇 변수에 어떤 주소값이든 담을 수 있다.
return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input ref={주소값을_담는_그릇} type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
        {/* React에서 사용 가능한 ref라는 속성에 주소값을_담는_그릇을 값으로 할당하면*/}
        {/* 주소값을_담는_그릇 변수에는 input DOM 엘리먼트의 주소가 담긴다. */}
        {/* 향후 다른 컴포넌트에서 input DOM 엘리먼트를 활용할 수 있다. */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
~~~

이 주소값은 컴포넌트가 re-render 되더라도 바뀌지 않는다. 
{:.figure}

~~~js
function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () =&gt; {
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;input ref={inputEl} type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={onButtonClick}&gt;Focus the input&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
~~~

컴포넌트가 re-render 되더라도 주소값이 바뀌지 않는 특성을 활용하여 위의 제한된 상황에서 useRef를 활용할 수 있다.
{:.figure}

제시된 상황을 제외한 대부분의 경우 기본 리액트 문법을 벗어나 useRef를 남용하는 것은 부적절하고, React의 특징이자 장점인 선언적 프로그래밍 원칙과 배치되기 때문에, 조심해서 사용해야 한다.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;231-what-is-priority-queue&quot;&gt;2.3.1 What is Priority Queue?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a priority queue not only pass the element into the queue &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFF190;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;but also pass the priority of the element.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if all the priorities are the same number it’s going to behave just like a normal queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you pass in elements at different priorities the elements that are passed in with a higher priority are sent to the beginning of the queue.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;31-what-is-set&quot;&gt;3.1 What is Set?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set data structure is &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFF190&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;kind of like an array except there are no duplicate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 items and the values are not in any particular order. &lt;br /&gt;
The typical use for set is to simply check for the presence of an item.

&lt;p&gt;Binary Tree’s each node can only has two branches. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFF190; font-size:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Binary Search Trees are ordered. Each left subtree is less than or equal to the painter node.&lt;/em&gt; And each right subtree is greater than or equal to the parent node. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they use the principle of binary search. On average operations are able to skip about half of the tree so that each lookup insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an unsorted array but slower than the corresponding o perations on a hash table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-graph&quot;&gt;5. Graph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;51-what-is-graph&quot;&gt;5.1 What is Graph?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphs are collections of things and &lt;u&gt;the relationships or connections&lt;/u&gt; between them. &lt;br /&gt;
The data in a graph are called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nodes or vertices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The connections between the nodes are called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;52-type-of-graph&quot;&gt;5.2 Type of Graph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undirected and Directed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph_Undirected and Directed&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undirected graphs are graphs without any direction on the edges between nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ex) social network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed graphs are graphs with a direction and its edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ex)  internet and web page links. The nodes are web pages and the directed edges are links to other pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;531-adjacency-list&quot;&gt;5.3.1 Adjacency List&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFF190; font-size:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjacency List associates each vertex in the graph with the collection of its neighboring vertices or edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph_adjacency list and matrix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph_Adjacency list and Matrix&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;532-adjacency-matrix&quot;&gt;5.3.2 Adjacency Matrix&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFF190; font-size:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjacency Matrix is a two-dimensional array where each nested array has the same number of
elements as the outer array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So it’s basically a matrix of numbers where the numbers represent the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;533-incidence-matrix&quot;&gt;5.3.3 Incidence Matrix&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/data-structures-and-algorithms/graph_incidence matrix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph_Incidence Matrix&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjacency Matrix use both rows and columns to represent nodes.&lt;br /&gt;
But &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #FFF190; font-size:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incidence Matrix uses roads to represent nodes and the columns to represent edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
This means that we can have an uneven number of rows and columns.
Each column will represent a unique edge. Also, each edge connects two nodes to show that there is edge between two nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

## Step 1 : Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You’ll see here that we have five components in our app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents. The numbers in the image correspond to the numbers below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

1. FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
2. SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
3. ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
4. ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
5. ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product

If you look at ProductTable, you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is ProductTable’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

* FilterableProductTable
  * SearchBar 
  * ProductTable 
    * ProductCategoryRow 
    * ProductRow 

## Step 2 : Build A Static Version in React

Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Step 3 : Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Think of all the pieces of data in our example application. We have:
* The original list of products
* The search text the user has entered
* The value of the checkbox
* The filtered list of products

Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:
1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

The original list of products is passed in as props, so that’s not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can’t be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So finally, our state is:
* The search text the user has entered
* The value of the checkbox

## Step 4 : Identify Where Your State Should Live

OK, so we’ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand, so follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:

Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
Let’s run through this strategy for our application:

ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.
The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.
It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable
Cool, so we’ve decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable’s constructor to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar.

You can start seeing how your application will behave: set filterText to &quot;ball&quot; and refresh your app. You’ll see that the data table is updated correctly.

So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.

React makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.

If you try to type or check the box in the previous version of the example (step 4), you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable.

Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.

## Step 5 : Add Inverse Data Flow

So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

React makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you try to type or check the box in the previous version of the example (step 4), you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## git add -A/./u 비교


|명령어|새 파일　　|수정된 파일　　|삭제된 파일　　|설명|
|:-----:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----:|
|git add -A|	✔️|	✔️|	✔️	|깃의 관리하에 있는 디렉토리(상위 폴더 포함)에서 새, 수정된, 삭제된 파일을 모두 staging area에 추가|
|git add .	|✔️	|✔️	|✔️	|현재 폴더에서 새, 수정된, 삭제된 파일을 &lt;br&gt; 모두 staging area에 추가|
|git add --ignore-removal .|	✔️	|✔️|	❌|	새, 수정된 파일만 staging area에 추가|
|git add -u	|❌	|✔️|	✔️	|수정된, 삭제된 파일만 staging area에 추가|

Long-form flags:
* git add -A is equivalent to git add --all
* git add -u is equivalent to git add --update


git add -p : 변경사항을 일일이 확인하면서 넘길 수 있어 편리하다. (하지만 모든 파일을 넘길 순 없는 듯 하다)
