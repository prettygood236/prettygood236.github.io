    Simply put, a data structure is a container that stores data in a specific layout. This "placement" allows a data structure to be efficient in some operations but inefficient in others. Your goal is to understand data structures so that you can choose the data structures that are best for the problem at hand. 
    In its most general sense, an algorithm is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to turn a set of facts about the world into useful information. Facts are data and useful information is knowledge for people, instructions to machines, or input for another algorithm. There are many common examples of algorithms, from sorting numbers to finding a route through a map to displaying information on a screen.
