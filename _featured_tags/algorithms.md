    In its most general sense, an algorithm is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to turn a set of facts about the world into useful information. Facts are data and useful information is knowledge for people, instructions to machines, or input for another algorithm. There are many common examples of algorithms, from sorting numbers to finding a route through a map to displaying information on a screen.
